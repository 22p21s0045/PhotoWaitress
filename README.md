# PhotoWaitress

## Overview

This platform is designed to automate the workflow for photographers who find it tedious to manually add presets, export raw files, and manage the entire post-processing routine. Our platform streamlines the process by automatically applying presets to raw images, handling exports, and organizing the workflow, saving photographers valuable time and effort. 

With this automation, photographers can focus more on their creative work and less on repetitive tasks, ensuring a faster and more efficient image processing pipeline. Whether it's adding exposure adjustments exporting files in various formats, this platform takes care of it all, leaving the photographer with more time to focus on their art.
